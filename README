PyBugz - Python Bugzilla Interface
----------------------------------

Bugzilla has a very inefficient user interface, so I've written a
command line utility to interact with it. This is mainly done to help
me with closing bugs on Gentoo Bugzilla by grabbing patches, ebuilds
and so on.

Features
--------
* Searching bugzilla
* Listing details of a bug including comments and attachments
* Downloading/viewing attachments from bugzilla
* Posting bugs, comments, and making changes to an existing bug.
* Adding attachments to a bug.

Configuration File
------------------

pybugz supports a configuration file which allows you to define settings
for multiple bugzilla connections then refer to them by name from the
command line. The default is for this file to be named .bugzrc and
stored in your home directory. An example of this file and the settings
is included in this distribution as bugzrc.example.

Usage/Workflow
--------------

PyBugz comes with a command line interface called "bugz". It's
operation is similar in style to cvs/svn where a subcommand is
required for operation. 

To explain how it works, I will use a typical workflow for Gentoo
development. 

1) Searching bugzilla for bugs I can fix, I'll run the command:
---------------------------------------------------------------

$ bugz search "version bump" --assigned liquidx@gentoo.org

 * Using http://bugs.gentoo.org/ ..
 * Searching for "version bump" ordered by "number"
 101968 liquidx              net-im/msnlib version bump
 125468 liquidx              version bump for dev-libs/g-wrap-1.9.6
 130608 liquidx              app-dicts/stardict version bump: 2.4.7

2) Narrow down on bug #101968, I can execute:
---------------------------------------------

$ bugz get 101968

 * Using http://bugs.gentoo.org/ ..
 * Getting bug 130608 ..

[ATTACH] [87844] [stardict 2.4.7 ebuild]

[Comment #1] dushistov@----.ru : 2006-04-20 07:36 PST
...

3) Now this bug has an attachment submitted by the user, so I can
   easily pull that attachment in:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

$ bugz attachment 87844

 * Using http://bugs.gentoo.org/ ..
 * Getting attachment 87844
 * Saving attachment: "stardict-2.4.7.ebuild"

4) If the ebuild is suitable, we can commit it using our normal
   repoman tools, and close the bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------

$ bugz modify 130608 --fixed -c "Thanks for the ebuild. Committed to
  portage" 

or if we find that the bug is invalid, we can close it by using:

$ bugz modify 130608 --invalid -c "Not reproducable"

Other options
-------------

There is extensive help in `bugz --help` and `bugz <subcommand>
--help` for additional options. 

bugz.py can be easily adapted for other bugzillas by changing
BugzConfig to match the configuration of your target
bugzilla. However, I haven't spent much time on using it with other
bugzillas out there. If you do have changes that will make it easier,
please let me know.
