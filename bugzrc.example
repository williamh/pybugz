# bugzrc.example - an example configuration file for pybugz
#
# This file consists of sections which define parameters for each
# bugzilla you plan to use.
#
# Each section begins with a name in square brackets. This is also the
# name that should be used with the --connection  parameter to the bugz
# command.
#
# Each section of this file consists of lines in the form:
# key: value
# as listed below.
#
# [sectionname]
#
# The base url of the bugzilla you wish to use.
# This must point to the xmlrpc.cgi script on the bugzilla installation.
#
# base: http://my.project.com/bugzilla/xmlrpc.cgi
#
# It is also possible to encode a username and password into this URL
# for basic http authentication as follows:
#
# base: http://myhttpname:myhttppasswd@my.project.com/bugzilla/xmlrpc.cgi
#
# Next are your username and password for this bugzilla. If you do not
# provide these, you will be prompted for them.
#
# user: myname@my.project.com
# password: secret2
#
# As an alternative to keeping your password in this file you can provide a
# password command. It is evaluated and pybugz expects this command to output
# the password to standard out. E.g.:
#
# passwordcmd: gpg2 --decrypt /myhome/.my-encrypted-password.gpg
#
# The number of columns your terminal can display.
# Most of the time you should not have to set this.
#
# columns: 80
#
# Set the output encoding for pybugz.
#
# encoding: utf-8
#
# Run in quiet mode.
#
# quiet: True
#
# A "bugz alias" that allows the name of the 'bugz' binary to determine
# which connection to use.
# E.g. suppose you have a [gnome] section for http://bugzilla.gnome.org,
# Create a symblink to the 'bugz' binary named 'gnomebz'.
# Add "bugz-alias: gnomebz" to the [gnome] section then
# invoking "gnomebz" would work like "bugz --connection gnome".
# 
# bugz-alias: gnomebz
#
# The special section named 'default' may also be used. Other sections will
# override any values specified here. The optional special key 'connection' is
# used to name the default connection, to use when no --connection parameter is
# specified to the bugz command.
#
# [default]
# connection: sectionname
#
# All parameters listed above can be used in the default section if you
# only use one bugzilla installation.
